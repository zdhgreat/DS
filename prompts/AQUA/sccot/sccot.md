## Problem: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
## Answer Choice: A) 1/2 B) 3/2 C) 5/2 D) 4/2 E) 7/2

Let's think this through step by step.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        3/2
        **Answer(option choice)**
        B
