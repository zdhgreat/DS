## Problem: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?
## Answer Choices: A) 53 km B) 55 km C) 52 km D) 60 km E) 50 km

### Entities: Travel speed, Travel time

### Event Hints:
    1. The person is traveling at a constant speed of 20 km/hr.
    2. The travel time to reach the destination is 2.5 hours.
    3. The distance traveled can be found by multiplying the speed by the travel time.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        50
        **Answer(option choice)**
        E

## Problem: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?
## Answer Choice: A) 50 B) 45 C) 65 D) 78 E) 64

### Entities: Original average of numbers, Increment added to each number

### Event Hints:
    1. The initial average of 15 numbers is 40.
    2. An increment of 10 is added to each number.
    3. Adding the same value to each number in a dataset increases the mean by that value.
    4. The new mean of the numbers will be 50.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        50
        **Answer(option choice)**

## Problem: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
## Answer Choice: A) 1/2 B) 3/2 C) 5/2 D) 4/2 E) 7/2

### Entities: Ratio a/b, Equation 8a + 5b = 22

### Event Hints:
Value of a:
    1. The given ratio a/b=3/4 implies a=3b/4.
    2. Substituting a=3b/4 in the linear equation 8a+5b=22 allows for the calculation of b.
    3. Once b is determined, a can be calculated using the proportionality a=3b/4.
    4. These steps provide a method to solve for a using algebraic manipulation based on the proportionality and linear equation.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        3/2
        **Answer(option choice)**
        B
