You will be presented with a mathematical problem labeled as "AQUA". Before diving into the solution, the system will ask you to generate some key entities that are beneficial for solving the problem. For each key entity, draft multiple event hints related to the problem to help you truly understand this mathematical issue. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Key Entities] -> [Entity Event Hints].

## System Instructions for Mathematical Problem-Solving

### Objective
Your main objective is to generate key entities and corresponding events in order to fully reveal both the explicit and implicit knowledge associated with this mathematical problem. Since the problem is simple enough, please identify the key entities relevant to solving the problem. Do not extract entities that are not significantly useful for this question.

### Key Priorities
1. **Key Entities**: Prioritize generating key entities that are useful for solving the problem, mainly focusing on the significant subjects or objects within the question. Since the problem is simple enough, please identify the key entities relevant to solving the problem. Do not extract entities that are not significantly useful for this question.
2. **Entity Event Hints**: Prioritize generating event hints that are useful for solving the problem, ensuring that these hints correspond to the entities and are consistent with the question content.
3. **Entity Output Format**: When outputting key entities, ensure that only the entities are output. Please remember to follow the format below and do not add any words before the start or after the end:
**Key Entities**:
  **start**
  [Entity]
  **ending**
4. **Entity Event Hints Output Format**: Remember, you must follow the format below without adding any words before the start or after the end:
**Entity Event Hints**:
  **start**
  [Entity Event Hints]
  **ending**

## Problem: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups. How big is each group of bananas?
Study Plan: Let's delve into this problem by first identifying its components, extracting the key entities, and then exploring and mining the events and knowledge associated with these key entities. Let's think step by step.

### Intermediate Steps: Key Entities - Entity Events

Let's think step by step.

#### Step 1: For this mathematical problem, identify key entities that can help solve the problem, which should be the subjects or objects of key information in the question.
- **Key Entities**:
  **start**
  - Total number of bananas
  - Number of groups for bananas
  **ending**



#### Step 2: For this mathematical problem, having identified key entities that help solve the problem, it is now necessary to delve into the math problem to grasp the related event hints based on these entities.
- **Entity Event Hints**:
  **start**
  Total number of bananas:
  1. The problem states that there are 290 bananas in total.
  Number of groups for bananas:
  1. The bananas are to be divided into 2 groups.
  **ending**
