## Problem: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?
## Answer Choices: A) 53 km B) 55 km C) 52 km D) 60 km E) 50 km

### Entities: Travel speed, Travel time

### Event Hints:
Travel speed:
1. The person is traveling at a speed of 20 km/hr.
Travel time:
1. The travel duration is 2.5 hours.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        The distance that the person traveled would have been 20 km/hr * 2.5 hrs = 50 km
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        50
        **Answer(option choice)**
        E

## Problem: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?
## Answer Choice: A) 50 B) 45 C) 65 D) 78 E) 64

### Entities: Original average of numbers, Increment added to each number

### Event Hints:
Original average of numbers:
1. The average of the numbers initially is 40.
Increment added to each number:
1. Each number is increased by an increment of 10.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        50
        **Answer(option choice)**
        A

## Problem: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
## Answer Choice: A) 1/2 B) 3/2 C) 5/2 D) 4/2 E) 7/2

### Entities: Ratio a/b, Equation 8a + 5b = 22

### Event Hints:
Ratio a/b:
1. The ratio a/b is given as 3/4, meaning a is 3/4 of b.
Equation 8a + 5b = 22:
1. The equation 8a + 5b = 22 must be used alongside the ratio to find the values of a and b.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        3/2
        **Answer(option choice)**
        B
