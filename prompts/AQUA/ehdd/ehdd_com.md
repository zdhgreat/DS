## Problem: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?
## Answer Choices: A) 53 km B) 55 km C) 52 km D) 60 km E) 50 km

### Entities: Travel speed, Travel time

### Event Hints:
Travel speed:
1. The person is traveling at a speed of 20 km/hr.
Travel time:
1. The travel duration is 2.5 hours.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        The person is traveling at a constant speed of 20 km/hr.
        The total time taken to reach the destination is 2.5 hours.
        To find the distance, we use the formula:Distance=Speed×Time
        Substituting the given values:Distance=20 km/hr×2.5 hr
        Calculate the product:Distance=50 km
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**

## Problem: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?
## Answer Choice: A) 50 B) 45 C) 65 D) 78 E) 64

### Entities: Original average of numbers, Increment added to each number

### Event Hints:
Original average of numbers:
1. The average of the numbers initially is 40.
Increment added to each number:
1. Each number is increased by an increment of 10.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        The average of 15 numbers is 40, which means the sum of these numbers can be found by multiplying the average by the number of numbers.
        Sum of the numbers = 15 * 40 = 600.
        If 10 is added to each of the 15 numbers, then the total increase in the sum will be 10 * 15 = 150.
        The new sum of the numbers will be 600 + 150 = 750.
        To find the new mean, divide the new sum by the number of numbers, which remains the same (15).
        New mean = 750 / 15 = 50.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        50
        **Answer(option choice)**

## Problem: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
## Answer Choice: A) 1/2 B) 3/2 C) 5/2 D) 4/2 E) 7/2

### Entities: Ratio a/b, Equation 8a + 5b = 22

### Event Hints:
Ratio a/b:
1. The ratio a/b is given as 3/4, meaning a is 3/4 of b.
Equation 8a + 5b = 22:
1. The equation 8a + 5b = 22 must be used alongside the ratio to find the values of a and b.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        We are given the equation a/b=3/4. From this, we can express a=(3/4)×b.
        We also have the equation 8a+5b=22. Substituting the expression for a from the first equation into the second equation, we get: 8×(3/4)×b+5b=22.
        This simplifies to:6b+5b=22.
        Combining like terms, we get:11b=22.
        Solving for b, we divide both sides by 11: b=2.
        Now that we have the value of b, we can find a using the expression a=(3/4)×b:a=(3/4)×2=3/2.
        Thus, the value of a is 3/2.
