You will be presented with a mathematical problem labeled as "svamp". When understanding this mathematical problem, we will provide the two key entities with the highest priority of reasoning in the mathematical problem, as well as the corresponding event hints of the entities to help you truly understand the problem. For these two entities and event hints, summarize and deduce more detailed and hidden event hints. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Entity Event Hints] -> [Summary].

### Goal
Your primary goal is to summarize and explore the given two key entities and event hints, in order to fully deduce summary event hints and hidden reasoning knowledge that can solve the mathematical problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Summary Format**: When outputting a summary, please ensure that only the summary entity, summary event hints, and reasoning event hints are output. Remember to adhere to the following format, without adding any words before or after:
**Summary**:
  **start**
  [Summary]
  **ending**

## Problem: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups. How big is each group of bananas?

### Entity Event Hints:
Total number of bananas:
1. The problem states that there are 290 bananas in total.
Number of groups for bananas:
1. The bananas are to be divided into 2 groups.


Let's think step by step.

#### Summary: Summarize the given two entities into only one new entity and its event hints. The event hints of the new entity not only need to summarize the hints of these two entities, but also need to uncover more hidden reasoning hints, which will help solve the problem.
- **Summary**:
  **start**
  Banana Group Size:
  1. The total collection includes 290 bananas.
  2. These bananas are to be organized into 2 groups.
  3. Dividing the total number of bananas by the number of groups provides the size of each group.
