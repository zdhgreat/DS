## Problem: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?
### Entities: Hamsters, Predators
### Event Hints:
    1. Hamsters are small rodents native to regions in Europe and Asia, and they are a common prey for various predators due to their size and habitat.
    2. Predatory birds such as owls and hawks, as well as mammals like foxes, weasels, and snakes, regularly hunt and consume wild hamsters.
    3. Domestic cats may also prey on pet hamsters if they have the opportunity, reflecting their inherent predatory instincts towards small animals.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Hamsters are prey animals.
        Prey are food for predators.
        Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals.
        So the answer is yes.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        Yes
    **ending**


## Problem: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?
### Entities: Brooke Shields, University of Pennsylvania
### Event Hints:
    1. Brooke Shields, an American actress and model, has demonstrated intelligence and academic dedication by graduating from Princeton University with a degree in French literature.
    2. The University of Pennsylvania, a prestigious Ivy League institution in Philadelphia, offers rigorous academic programs and has a history of successful alumni.
    3. Given her academic background and the supportive environment of the University of Pennsylvania, Brooke Shields is well-positioned to succeed academically at this institution.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Brooke Shields went to Princeton University.
        Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania.
        Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania.
        So the answer is yes.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        Yes
    **ending**



## Problem: Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?
### Entities: Hydrogen, Spice Girls
### Event Hints:
    1. Hydrogen, the first element on the periodic table, has an atomic number of 1, which, when squared, results in 1.
    2. The Spice Girls, a famous British girl group from the 1990s, originally consisted of five members.
    3. Since 1 (Hydrogen's atomic number squared) is less than 5 (number of Spice Girls members), Hydrogen's atomic number squared does not exceed the number of Spice Girls members.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1.
        1 squared is 1.
        There are 5 Spice Girls.
        Thus, Hydrogen's atomic number squared is less than 5.
        So the answer is no.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        No
    **ending**



## Problem: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements? In the absence of predators?
### Entities: Frost, College Commencements
### Event Hints:
    1. Frost occurs when temperatures reach or drop below freezing, typically in late autumn, winter, or early spring, influenced by geographic location and climate.
    2. College commencements are usually held in late spring or early summer, though some institutions may schedule them in mid to late autumn.
    3. Given the usual timing of college commencements in late spring and early summer, it is uncommon to see frost during these events, unless held in regions with unique climatic conditions that allow for late-season frosts.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June.
        December is in the winter, so there can be frost.
        Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.
        So the answer is Yes.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        Yes
    **ending**


## Problem:  Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?
### Entities: Llama, War in Vietnam (1945-46)
### Event Hints:
    1. Llamas, domesticated camelids from South America, have a gestation period of approximately 11.5 months, typically birthing a single offspring.
    2. The War in Vietnam (1945-46) spanned from September 1945 to March 1946, a duration of about 7 months.
    3. Given the gestation period of llamas, it is biologically improbable for a llama to give birth twice within the 7-month span of the War in Vietnam.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        The War in Vietnam was 6 months.
        The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months.
        Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam.
        The answer is no.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        No
    **ending**


## Problem: Would a pear sink in water?
### Entities: Pear, Water
### Event Hints:
    1. Pears, varying in size and water content, generally have a density slightly less than water, enabling them to float.
    2. Water's density is approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter at room temperature, serving as the reference point for an object's buoyancy.
    3. An object’s ability to float or sink in water is determined by comparing its density to water’s density; most pears will float due to their lower density.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        The density of a pear is about 0.6g/cm3, which is less than water.
        Objects less dense than water float.
        Thus, a pear would float.
        The answer is no.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        No
