You will be presented with an open-domain question labeled as "StrategyQA". When understanding this open-domain problem, we will provide the two key entities with the highest priority of reasoning in this problem, as well as the corresponding event hints of the entities to help you truly understand the problem. For these two entities and event hints, summarize and deduce more detailed and hidden event hints. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Entity Event Hints] -> [Summary].

### Goal
Your primary goal is to summarize and explore the given two key entities and event hints, in order to fully deduce summary event hints and hidden reasoning knowledge that can solve the open-domain problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Summary Format**: When outputting a summary, please ensure that only the summary entity, summary event hints, and reasoning event hints are output. Remember to adhere to the following format, without adding any words before or after:
**Summary**:
  **start**
  [Summary]

3. The swastikaâ€™s design, a hooked cross, appears in various forms in the art and symbolism of many ancient cultures, including the Native Americans.


Let's think step by step.

#### Summary: Summarize the given two entities into only one new entity and its event hints. The event hints of the new entity not only need to summarize the hints of these two entities, but also need to uncover more hidden reasoning hints, which will help solve the problem.
