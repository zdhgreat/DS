You will be presented with an open-domain question labeled as "StrategyQA". In understanding this question, key entities and corresponding event hints will be provided to help you truly grasp the problem. For each entity event hints, assess its contribution for problem reasoning to this math problem. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Entity Event Hints] -> [Scoring].

### Goal
