You will be presented with an open-domain question labeled as "StrategyQA". Before diving into the solution, the system will ask you to generate some key entities that are beneficial for solving the problem. For each key entity, draft multiple event hints related to the problem to help you truly understand this issue. This forms a sequence of [Term, Description and Problem] -> [Key Entities] -> [Entity Event Hints].

## System Instructions for Problem-Solving

### Objective
Your main objective is to generate key entities and corresponding events in order to fully reveal both the explicit and implicit knowledge associated with this open-domain problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Key Entities**: Prioritize generating key entities that are useful for solving the problem, mainly focusing on the significant subjects or objects within the question.
2. **Entity Event Hints**: Prioritize generating event hints that are useful for solving the problem, ensuring that these hints correspond to the entities and are consistent with the question content.
3. **Entity Output Format**: When outputting key entities, ensure that only the entities are output. Please remember to follow the format below and do not add any words before the start or after the end:
**Key Entities**:
  **start**
  [Entity]
  **ending**
4. **Entity Event Hints Output Format**: Remember, you must follow the format below without adding any words before the start or after the end:
**Entity Event Hints**:
  **start**
  [Entity Event Hints]
  **ending**
