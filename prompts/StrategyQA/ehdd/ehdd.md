## Problem: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?
### Entities: Hamsters, Predators
### Event Hints:
Hamsters:
1. Hamsters are small rodents often kept as pets.
2. They are generally not part of a natural food chain involving larger predators in domestic settings.
Predators:
1. Predators are animals that naturally hunt and consume other animals for food.
2. In wild or natural settings, smaller rodents like wild hamsters could potentially be prey for larger predators.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Hamsters are prey animals.
        Prey are food for predators.
        Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals.
        So the answer is yes.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        Yes

## Problem: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?
### Entities: Brooke Shields, University of Pennsylvania
### Event Hints:
Brooke Shields:
1. Known for her acting and modeling career, potentially impacting her academic pursuits.
2. Her ability to succeed academically would depend on various personal and academic factors, not just her fame.
University of Pennsylvania:
1. Known for its rigorous academic environment, which would challenge any student, including Brooke Shields.
2. Offers diverse programs that might align with her interests or career goals.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Brooke Shields went to Princeton University.
        Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania.
        Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania.
        So the answer is yes.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        Yes
    **ending**



## Problem: Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?
### Entities: Hydrogen, Spice Girls
### Event Hints:
Hydrogen's atomic number:
1. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, which is a basic fact in chemistry.
Number of Spice Girls:
1. The Spice Girls originally consisted of 5 members.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1.
        1 squared is 1.
        There are 5 Spice Girls.
        Thus, Hydrogen's atomic number squared is less than 5.
        So the answer is no.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        No
    **ending**



## Problem: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements? In the absence of predators?
### Entities: Frost, College Commencements
### Event Hints:
Frost:
1. Frost typically forms under clear skies and cold temperatures.
2. Frost is more common in specific seasons, like late fall or early winter.
College commencements:
1. College commencements generally occur in late spring or early summer.
2. The timing of college commencements might coincide with unusual weather patterns depending on geographical location.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June.
        December is in the winter, so there can be frost.
        Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.
        So the answer is Yes.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        Yes
    **ending**


## Problem:  Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?
### Entities: Llama, War in Vietnam
### Event Hints:
Llama:
1. Llamas typically have a gestation period of about 350 days (nearly a year).
2. Given the period of the War in Vietnam stated (1945-46), it spans about a year.
War in Vietnam:
1. The years 1945-46 mark the beginning of the conflict associated with the First Indochina War which includes Vietnam's struggles.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:

        **Thought**
        The War in Vietnam was 6 months.
        The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months.
        Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam.
        The answer is no.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        No

## Problem: Would a pear sink in water?
### Entities: Pear, Water
### Event Hints:
Pear:
1. The pear's density compared to water is crucial to determine if it sinks or floats.
Water:
2. Water has a standard density which serves as a reference for whether objects will sink or float in it.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        The density of a pear is about 0.6g/cm3, which is less than water.
        Objects less dense than water float.
        Thus, a pear would float.
        The answer is no.
        **Answer(Yes or No)**
        No
