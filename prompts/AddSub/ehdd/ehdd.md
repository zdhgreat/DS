#### Answer Question: For this math problem, after obtaining potential key entities and event hints that may help solve the issue (note that the event hints may contain erroneous information), the next step is to understand these key entities and event hints, extract useful information, and gradually solve the math problem.
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            Janet receives a daily total of 16 eggs. Out of these, she utilizes 7 eggs for personal consumption—3 eggs for her breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. Consequently, she has \(16 - 3 - 4 = 9\) eggs remaining. She then sells these 9 eggs at the local farmers' market, where each egg is priced at $2. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling eggs are \(9 \times 2 = $18\). Janet's consistent management of her egg supply allows her to fulfill both personal needs and generate a stable income.
