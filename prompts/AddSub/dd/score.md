You will be presented with a mathematical problem labeled as "AddSub". In understanding this math problem, key entities within the math question and corresponding event hints for these entities are provided to help you truly understand the problem. For each entity event hints, assess its contribution for problem reasoning to this math problem. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Entity Event Hints] -> [Scoring].

### Goal
Your primary goal is to score the event hints of key entities to fully reveal their priority relevance to the math problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Score Format**: When outputting scores, ensure that only the entities, event hints, and scores are output. Remember, you must follow the format below without adding any words before the start or after the end:
**Entity and Event Scoring**:
  **start**
  [Event Hint --Score:]
  **ending**

## Problem: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups. How big is each group of bananas?

### Entity Event Hints:
Total number of bananas:
1. The problem states that there are 290 bananas in total.
Number of groups for bananas:
1. The bananas are to be divided into 2 groups.

Just score the event hints.

#### Score:Just score the event hints, no summary or synthesis is needed. Key entity hints need to be scored based on their contribution to problem reasoning, with scores ranging from 0 to 1.
