## Problem: Julia played tag with 2 kids on monday, 14 kids on tuesday and 16 kids on wednesday. How many kids did she play with on tuesday and wednesday?

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday and 16 kids on Wednesday. To find the total number of kids she played with on Tuesday and Wednesday, we need to sum the number of kids she played with on each day. Therefore, the total number of kids she played with on Tuesday and Wednesday is \(14 + 16 = 30\).
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        30

## Problem: 26 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 38 more children got on the bus. How many children are on the bus now?

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Initially, there were 26 children on the bus. At the bus stop, 38 more children got on the bus. To find the total number of children on the bus now, we need to add the initial number of children to the number of children who got on at the stop. Therefore, the total number of children on the bus now is \(26 + 38 = 64\).
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        64

## Problem: A grocery store had 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda. How many more bottles of diet soda than regular soda did they have?

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        To find the difference in the number of diet soda and regular soda bottles, we need to subtract the total number of regular soda bottles from the total number of diet soda bottles. Given that the grocery store has 61 bottles of diet soda and 22 bottles of regular soda, we can calculate the difference as follows:Diet Soda Bottles - Regular Soda Bottles = 61 - 22 = 39.Therefore, the grocery store has 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        39

## Problem: Baker made 110 cakes. He sold 75 of them. Then he made 76 more cakes. How many cakes would baker still have?

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Initially, the baker made 110 cakes. He then sold 75 cakes, leaving him with \(110 - 75 = 35\) cakes. After selling these cakes, the baker made an additional 76 cakes. To find the total number of cakes the baker would still have, we need to add the additional cakes made to the remaining cakes after selling. Therefore, the total number of cakes the baker would still have is \(35 + 76 = 111\).
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        111

## Problem: The ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day. In total in 5 days they earned 165 dollars. How much did they make per day?

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        If the carnival made a total of $165 over 5 days, we can find the amount made per day by dividing the total earnings by the number of days. Therefore, the amount made per day is \( \frac{165}{5} = $33 \). This means that the ring toss game at the carnival made $33 per day consistently over the 5-day period.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        33
