You will be presented with an open-domain question labeled as "CommonsenseQA". When understanding this open-domain problem, we will provide the two key entities with the highest priority of reasoning in this problem, as well as the corresponding event hints of the entities to help you truly understand the problem. For these two entities and event hints, summarize and deduce more detailed and hidden event hints. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Entity Event Hints] -> [Summary].

### Goal
Your primary goal is to summarize and explore the given two key entities and event hints, in order to fully deduce summary event hints and hidden reasoning knowledge that can solve the open-domain problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Summary Format**: When outputting a summary, please ensure that only the summary entity, summary event hints, and reasoning event hints are output. Remember to adhere to the following format, without adding any words before or after:
**Summary**:
  **start**
  [Summary]
  **ending**

## Problem: A revolving door is convenient for two direction travel, but it also serves as a security measure at a what?

### Entity Event Hints:
Revolving Door:
1. Revolving doors are commonly used in commercial and public buildings for efficient ingress and egress.
2. These doors help maintain the internal climate of a building by reducing air exchange with the outside.
3.The structure of revolving doors naturally limits the flow of people, making unauthorized access more difficult.
Security Measure:
1. Security measures are protocols or systems designed to prevent unauthorized access or to ensure safety in buildings.
2. They are often implemented in places with high traffic or where sensitive information or valuable goods are housed.
3. Enhanced security measures, such as guards, surveillance cameras, or specialized entry systems like revolving doors, are particularly common in corporate or governmental buildings.


Let's think step by step.

#### Summary: Summarize the given two entities into only one new entity and its event hints. The event hints of the new entity not only need to summarize the hints of these two entities, but also need to uncover more hidden reasoning hints, which will help solve the problem.
- **Summary**:
  **start**
  Security and Efficiency via Revolving Doors:
  1. Revolving doors serve a dual role in commercial and public buildings, enhancing both the efficiency of traffic flow and maintaining the internal climate by minimizing air exchange.
  2. The design of revolving doors inherently limits the rate and volume of people entering or exiting, acting as a passive security measure to control access.
  3. Such doors are integral to security strategies in high-security areas, where they are combined with surveillance, guards, and other security protocols to protect against unauthorized access, particularly in corporate or governmental settings.
