## Problem: Where would you find a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted? 
## Answer Choices: A) forest canopy B) nature preserve C) zoo D) tropical rainforest E) commercial
### Entities: Sloth, Hunting Fear, Safe Locations
### Event Hints:
    1. Sloths' survival in their natural habitats relies on their ability to remain undetected, primarily through camouflage and staying in high canopy areas to avoid ground-level predators.

    3. These controlled environments not only simulate the natural conditions necessary for sloth well-being, such as tree-rich enclosures, but also enhance safety with measures like monitored enclosures and restricted access, ensuring that sloths can exhibit natural behaviors without the stress of predation.
