<system>
You will be presented with an open-domain question labeled as "CommonsenseQA". Before diving into the solution, the system will ask you to generate some key entities that are beneficial for solving the problem. For each key entity, draft multiple event hints related to the problem to help you truly understand this issue. This forms a sequence of [Problem and Choices] -> [Key Entities] -> [Entity Event Hints].

## System Instructions for Problem-Solving

### Objective
Your main objective is to generate key entities and corresponding events in order to fully reveal both the explicit and implicit knowledge associated with this open-domain problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Key Entities**: Prioritize generating key entities that are useful for solving the problem, mainly focusing on the significant subjects or objects within the question.
2. **Entity Event Hints**: Prioritize generating event hints that are useful for solving the problem, ensuring that these hints correspond to the entities and are consistent with the question content.
3. **Entity Output Format**: When outputting key entities, ensure that only the entities are output. Please remember to follow the format below and do not add any words before the start or after the end:
**Key Entities**:
  **start**
  [Entity]
  **ending**
4. **Entity Event Hints Output Format**: Remember, you must follow the format below without adding any words before the start or after the end:
**Entity Event Hints**:
  **start**
  [Entity Event Hints]
  **ending**

## Answer Choices: A)bank B)library C)department store D)mall E)new york


Study Plan: Let's delve into this problem by first identifying its components, extracting the key entities, and then exploring and mining the events and knowledge associated with these key entities. Let's think step by step.

### Intermediate Steps: Key Entities - Entity Events

Let's think step by step.

#### Step 1: For this open-domain problem, identify key entities that can help solve the problem, which should be the subjects or objects of key information in the question.
- **Key Entities**:
  **start**
  - Revolving Door
  - Security Measure
  - High-security Locations
  **ending**



#### Step 2: For this open-domain problem, having identified key entities that help solve the problem, it is now necessary to delve into this problem to grasp the related event hints based on these entities.
- **Entity Event Hints**:
  **start**
  Revolving Door:
  1. Revolving doors are used in various public buildings to manage both the flow of people and energy efficiency by minimizing air exchange.
  2. These doors can control the rate of entry and exit, making it easier to monitor and secure entrances in busy or sensitive areas.
  Security Measure:
  1. As a security measure, revolving doors prevent tailgating in sensitive buildings where controlling access is crucial, such as banks and corporate buildings.
  2. Their design can integrate with security systems like cameras and guards, enhancing overall security protocols.
  High-security Locations:
  1. Banks often use revolving doors to enhance security, preventing quick exits and controlling access.
  2. Department stores and malls use revolving doors for similar reasons, especially in urban areas where theft and security are significant concerns.
  3. The presence of revolving doors in such locations can deter theft and unauthorized access, aligning with stringent security measures.
