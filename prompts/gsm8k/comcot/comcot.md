## Problem: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        We start with 15 trees.

        The answer is 6.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
        Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah's sister had 42.
