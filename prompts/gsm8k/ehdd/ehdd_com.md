#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs each day.
            Each day, Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. That's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used daily.
            With 16 eggs laid and 7 used, the remainder that Janet has available to sell at the farmers' market each day is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.
            Janet sells each of the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling the eggs are 9 eggs × $2/egg = $18.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        18

## Problem: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?

### Entities: Angelo, Melanie, Textbook chapters, Worksheets, Study hours, Breaks, Snack breaks, Lunch

### Event Hints:

2. Each chapter requires 3 hours of study time.
Worksheets:
1. There are 4 worksheets to memorize.
2. Each worksheet requires 1.5 hours of study time.
Study hours per chapter:

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.
            Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.
            However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.
            They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.
            And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.
            So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.
            They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75
            They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**

## Problem: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.  What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?

### Entities: Mark's basketball team, Opponent's basketball team, 2 pointers, 3 pointers, Free throws

### Event Hints:
Number of 2 pointers:
1. Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, each worth 2 points.
Number of 3 pointers:
1. Mark's team scores 8 3 pointers, each worth 3 points.
Number of free throws:
1. Mark's team scores 10 free throws, each worth 1 point.
Opponent's score adjustments:
1. Opponents score double the 2 pointers of Mark's team.
2. Opponents score half the 3 pointers and free throws of Mark's team.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.
            His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers
            They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.
            All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points
            Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.
            His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers.
            They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws.
            All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points
            The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        201

## Problem: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?

### Entities: Bella, Marbles, Frisbees, Deck cards

### Event Hints:
Number of marbles:
1. Bella currently has 60 marbles.
Number of frisbees:
1. Bella has half as many frisbees as marbles.
2. The relationship between the marbles and frisbees is given by a ratio of 2:1.
Number of deck cards:
1. Bella has 20 fewer deck cards than frisbees.
2. There is a specific difference given between the number of deck cards and the number of frisbees.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24
            The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84
            If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.
            If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
            The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
            Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
            If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
            The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14
            Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        140
