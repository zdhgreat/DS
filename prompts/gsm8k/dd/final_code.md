## Problem: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

### Entities: Janet, Ducks, Eggs, Breakfast, Muffins, Friends, Farmers' market

### Event Hints:
  1. Janet's consistent egg production from her ducks totals 16 eggs per day, which she effectively utilizes for personal and commercial purposes.
  2. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 more for baking muffins, serving both her nutritional needs and social connections with friends.
  3. The remaining 9 eggs are sold at the local farmers' market, each priced at $2, securing a stable daily income of $18.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: For this math problem, after obtaining potential key entities and event hints that may help solve the issue (note that the event hints may contain erroneous information), the next step is to understand these key entities and event hints, extract useful information, and gradually solve the math problem.
**Solution**:
**start**
**Thought Process**
1. Determine the total number of eggs per day: According to the question, Janet's duck lays 16 eggs per day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs consumed for breakfast: The question mentioned that Janet eats 3 eggs every morning.
3. Calculate the number of eggs consumed for baking: She also uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for friends.
4. Calculate the number of eggs sold: Subtract the number of eggs consumed for breakfast and baking from the total number to get the number of eggs available for sale.
5. Calculate the daily income: Multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg to calculate Janet's daily income at the farmer's market.
**Python Code**
```python
# Define the total number of eggs per day
total_eggs = 16

# Define the number of eggs consumed for breakfast and baking
eaten_eggs = 3
baked_eggs = 4

# Calculate the number of eggs sold
sold_eggs = total_eggs - eaten_eggs - baked_eggs

# Define the selling price of each egg
dollars_per_egg = 2

# Calculate daily income
daily_income = sold_eggs * dollars_per_egg

# Output daily income
print(daily_income)
```
