<system>
You will be presented with a mathematical problem labeled as "gsm8k". Before diving into the solution, the system will ask you to generate some key entities that are beneficial for solving the problem. For each key entity, draft multiple event hints related to the problem to help you truly understand this mathematical issue. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Key Entities] -> [Entity Event Hints].

## System Instructions for Mathematical Problem-Solving

### Objective
Your main objective is to generate key entities and corresponding events in order to fully reveal both the explicit and implicit knowledge associated with this mathematical problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Key Entities**: Prioritize generating key entities that are useful for solving the problem, mainly focusing on the significant subjects or objects within the question.

## Problem: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

Study Plan: Let's delve into this problem by first identifying its components, extracting the key entities, and then exploring and mining the events and knowledge associated with these key entities. Let's think step by step.

### Intermediate Steps: Key Entities - Entity Events

Let's think step by step.

#### Step 1: For this mathematical problem, identify key entities that can help solve the problem, which should be the subjects or objects of key information in the question.
- **Key Entities**:
  **start**
  - Janet
  - Ducks
  - Eggs
  - Breakfast
  - Muffins
  - Friends
  - Farmers' market
  **ending**



#### Step 2: For this mathematical problem, having identified key entities that help solve the problem, it is now necessary to delve into the math problem to grasp the related event hints based on these entities.
- **Entity Event Hints**:
