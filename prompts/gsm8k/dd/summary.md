You will be presented with a mathematical problem labeled as "gsm8k". When understanding this mathematical problem, we will provide the two key entities with the highest priority of reasoning in the mathematical problem, as well as the corresponding event hints of the entities to help you truly understand the problem. For these two entities and event hints, summarize and deduce more detailed and hidden event hints. This forms a sequence of [Problem] -> [Entity Event Hints] -> [Summary].

### Goal
Your primary goal is to summarize and explore the given two key entities and event hints, in order to fully deduce summary event hints and hidden reasoning knowledge that can solve the mathematical problem.

### Key Priorities
1. **Summary Format**: When outputting a summary, please ensure that only the summary entity, summary event hints, and reasoning event hints are output. Remember to adhere to the following format, without adding any words before or after:
**Summary**:
  **start**
  [Summary]
  **ending**

## Problem: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? 

### Entity Event Hints:
eggs:
1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs daily.
2. Janet eats three eggs for breakfast every morning.
3. Janet uses four eggs daily to bake muffins.
4. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market.
5. Eggs are sold for $2 each at the farmers' market.
farmers' market:
1. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market.
2. The farmers' market is where Janet sells eggs.
3. Janet goes to the farmers' market every day.


Let's think step by step.

#### Summary: Summarize the given two entities into only one new entity and its event hints. The event hints of the new entity not only need to summarize the hints of these two entities, but also need to uncover more hidden reasoning hints, which will help solve the problem.
- **Summary**:
  **start**
  Egg sales:
  1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs daily, of which she consumes three for breakfast and uses four to bake muffins.
  2. After deducting her personal use, Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market.
  3. The eggs are priced at $2 each at the farmers' market.
  4. Janet visits the farmers' market daily to sell eggs.
