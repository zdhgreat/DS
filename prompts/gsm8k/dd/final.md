## Problem: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

### Entities: Janet, Ducks, Eggs, Breakfast, Muffins, Friends, Farmers' market

### Event Hints:
  1. Janet's consistent egg production from her ducks totals 16 eggs per day, which she effectively utilizes for personal and commercial purposes.
  2. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 more for baking muffins, serving both her nutritional needs and social connections with friends.
  3. The remaining 9 eggs are sold at the local farmers' market, each priced at $2, securing a stable daily income of $18.

Let's think this through step by step with the help of hints.

#### Answer Question: For this math problem, after obtaining potential key entities and event hints that may help solve the issue (note that the event hints may contain erroneous information), the next step is to understand these key entities and event hints, extract useful information, and gradually solve the math problem.
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            Janet receives a daily total of 16 eggs. Out of these, she utilizes 7 eggs for personal consumption—3 eggs for her breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. Consequently, she has \(16 - 3 - 4 = 9\) eggs remaining. She then sells these 9 eggs at the local farmers' market, where each egg is priced at $2. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling eggs are \(9 \times 2 = $18\). Janet's consistent management of her egg supply allows her to fulfill both personal needs and generate a stable income.
