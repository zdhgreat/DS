## Problem: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

### Entities: Janet, Ducks, Eggs, Breakfast, Muffins, Friends, Farmers' market


**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs each day.
            Each day, Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. That's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used daily.
            With 16 eggs laid and 7 used, the remainder that Janet has available to sell at the farmers' market each day is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.
            Janet sells each of the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling the eggs are 9 eggs × $2/egg = $18.
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**

## Problem: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?

### Entities: Angelo, Melanie, Textbook chapters, Worksheets, Study hours, Breaks, Snack breaks, Lunch


#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.
            Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.
            However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.
            They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.
            And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.
            So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.
            They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75
            They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.

## Problem: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.  What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?

### Entities: Mark's basketball team, Opponent's basketball team, 2 pointers, 3 pointers, Free throws


#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.
            His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers
            They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.
            All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points
            Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.
            His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers.
            They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws.
            All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points
            The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        201

## Problem: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?

### Entities: Bella, Marbles, Frisbees, Deck cards



#### Answer Question: 
**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24
            The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84
            If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.
            If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.
            The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42
            Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards
            If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards.
            The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14
            Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items
        **Answer(arabic numerals)**
        140
