## Problem: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?

### Entities: Janet, Ducks, Eggs, Breakfast, Muffins, Friends, Farmers' market


**Solution**:
    **start**
        **Thought**
            Janet receives a daily total of 16 eggs. Out of these, she utilizes 7 eggs for personal consumption—3 eggs for her breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. Consequently, she has \(16 - 3 - 4 = 9\) eggs remaining. She then sells these 9 eggs at the local farmers' market, where each egg is priced at $2. Therefore, her daily earnings from selling eggs are \(9 \times 2 = $18\). Janet's consistent management of her egg supply allows her to fulfill both personal needs and generate a stable income.
